Managing large photo collections has become a common challenge in the digital age, especially when it comes to labeling photos containing people. To address this issue, we have developed a photo management application designed to simplify the process of organizing and browsing images, even for very large collections. The face detection algorithm automatically extracts faces from photos, while a less accurate face recognition model is used to group faces based on their similarity to a reference model, rather than classifying them. This sorting process reduces the burden on users and enables quicker labeling. A user-friendly interface displays sorted faces as candidates for labeling, ensuring an efficient and intuitive experience. Our system automatically detects faces in photos and groups them based on their similarity to a chosen reference model, rather than classifying them. The design ensures that even very large photo collections are manageable, making it easier for users to organize and browse their images without being overwhelmed by the sheer volume. One of the key difficulties is effectively labeling photos that feature multiple individuals, which requires significant time and effort when done manually. To streamline this process, we present a photo management application that integrates a semi-automatic labeling system using advanced face detection and recognition technologies. This approach provides a significant improvement over traditional manual methods and holds potential for further advancements as technology evolves.
